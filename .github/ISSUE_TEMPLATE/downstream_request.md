## Downstream Project

**Project Name:** (e.g., ai-patent-eval, ai-grant-finder)
**Repository:** (link to the downstream repo)
**Issue/PR Link:** (link to the downstream issue/PR blocked by this)

## Request Type

- [ ] New feature needed
- [ ] Bug fix required
- [ ] API change needed
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Other (describe below)

## Description

Clear description of what the downstream project needs from ASMF.

## Current Behavior

What ASMF does now (or doesn't do) that's blocking the downstream project.

## Desired Behavior

What ASMF should do to unblock the downstream project.

## Proposed Solution (Optional)

If you have ideas about how to implement this in ASMF:

```python
# Example implementation
```

## Impact

- **Priority:** [ ] High (blocking) / [ ] Medium (workaround exists) / [ ] Low (nice to have)
- **Affected Downstream Projects:** (list all projects that would benefit)
- **Backward Compatibility:** [ ] Breaking change / [ ] Non-breaking

## Additional Context

Any other context, code samples, or links that would help implement this.
